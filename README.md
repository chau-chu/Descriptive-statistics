(1) frequency.do: use freq and tabulate commands to find number of panels in each waves of data and time frequency of each panel. 
(2) percentage_cut.do: use egen and cut functions 

Note: I use datasets created from the repository Vietnamdata > merge_data.do and frequently use estout, eststo, esttab commands for well-organised output tables
