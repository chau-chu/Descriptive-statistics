# Descriptive-statistics

(1) frequency.do: use FREQ and TABULATE commands to find number of panels in each waves of data and time frequency of each panel. 
(2) percentage_cut.do: use EGEN and CUT commands or use PCTILE command
(3) correlation_matrix.do: use PWCORR with Bonferroni-adjusted significance levels
(4) graphic_visuals.do: use KDENSITY or HISTOGRAM commands for Kernel density and histogram distribution 

Note: I use datasets created from the repository Vietnamdata > merge_data.do and frequently use estout, eststo, esttab commands for well-organised output tables
